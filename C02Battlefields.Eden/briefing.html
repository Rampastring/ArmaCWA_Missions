<B>Sunday, May 9</B> 
<br><br>
Dearest Mom and Dad,
<br><br>
Sorry it's been so long since I last wrote. But I hope you understand. We've been on full alert since the 25th of April, caught up in something called Operation ColdWarAssault. I haven't had a moment to write even the briefest of notes.
<br><br>
I know you'll be worried about me, but so far we've been very lucky. We've encountered hardly any enemy, and our platoon hasn't spotted a single one since the beginning of the op'. Hope it stays that way.
<br><br>
I don't know if this letter will get through to you, but I'm writing it anyway, just in case. I just want you all to know that I'm thinking of you, and can't wait to get back home.
<BR><BR>
Got to go now - looks like we're moving out again.
<br><br>
Your loving son, 
<br><br>
David
