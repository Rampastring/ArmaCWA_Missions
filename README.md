Collection of multiplayer missions for the 2001 light military simulator game Arma: Cold War Assault (originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis).

Some of the missions are made by me. Others are originally singleplayer missions created by the game's developer Bohemia Interactive, which I have converted for multiplayer. Copyright for these missions goes to Bohemia Interactive.
